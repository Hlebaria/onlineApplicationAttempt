The attempted application is a basic clicker site. The idea is simple, you click a big button and increase the counter on the screen by 1. 
The site is on HTML. The counter value is kept in a postgreSQL database. The app is made on Node.js. The app connects to the database and gives accurate values of the counter to the site. In return, the site increments the value, when a button is clikced.
Everything is run through Docker. Currently the application has trouble starting up in Docker.
